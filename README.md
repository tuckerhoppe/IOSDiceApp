# IOSDiceApp
# Overview

This is a simple dice roller app with some custom dice. There is one di for roommates, one di for fast food options, one di for colors and one for heads and tails.


Many times my roommates and I will playing a card game we don't know who to pick to start. We also are very indecisive when it comes to picking where to eat. This app helps with both!

# Future Work

* I would like to clean up the UI and make it look better than it does.
* I would like to add some numbered dice
* I would like to add a feature where the user can add some custom dice.
